# Bank OCR Kata

This is an experiment in screencasting my development process while working on https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Bank-OCR-kata.

I didn't take any time to edit the videos. There are 3 parts. The total runtime is just over 2 hours:

- Part1: https://youtu.be/v_VsTGWHhI0
- Part 2: https://youtu.be/zUlvNWqixE0
- Part 3: https://youtu.be/LaWm4IMcpb8
